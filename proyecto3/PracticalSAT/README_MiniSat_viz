========================================
MiniSat Visualizer
========================================

This demo runs MiniSat v1.14 and plots some statistics during the run.
Four benchmarks are distributed with this demo:

    bmc_satlib.cnf.gz
    hole9.cnf.gz
    pico_25.cnf.gz
    tptp-LCL415.cnf.gz

You have to hit SPACE to start the demo. You can pause the program by
hitting SPACE again.

The top plot (green lines) show the activity of the decision variables
that are picked. Long lines indicate high activity. The white line indicates
the front of the graph, as it paints over itself repeatedly.

The middle part (red lines) goes at a different pace: at each conflict,
the length of the conflict clause is show (1) before conflict clause
minimization (blue-grayish) and after minimization (the red lines).
On average there is a 30% gap between these two lines.

The bottom part (yellow lines) goes at the same pace as the middle part:
for each conflict, the decision level at which the conflict occurred is
plotted (light-blue line) and the level to which we backtrack (yellow).
Occasionally, there is a big back-jump resulting in a long blue line. Most
of the time, the yellow line covers the blue (short back-jump).

Restarts are shown as dotted red lines across the two bottom plots.
