========================================
MiniSat Demo
========================================

This demo runs MiniSat v1.14 and stops at selected points to display the
internal state. You can run it on small example to view the inner working of
MiniSat. Four benchmarks are distributed with this demo:

    small1.cnf
    small4.cnf
    small6.cnf
    tiny3.cnf

You can also try your own SAT problem (if they are small!).

NOTE: If you resize the window, you should do so before you start stepping
through the demo, or else the rewind function (BackSpace) will not work
properly.

Keys to use:

    Space     -- Step forward to next point of interest
    BackSpace -- Go back one step into history
    Return    -- Step forward to next major point of interest
    c         -- Jump to directly to next conflict
    q, Esc    -- Exit the program
